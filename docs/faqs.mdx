# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is QA Agent?
QA Agent is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates and validates unit tests for your codebase. It identifies functions with poor test coverage and creates appropriate tests to improve code quality.

### Which programming languages does QA Agent support?
Currently, QA Agent supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and SQL. We're working on adding support for more languages.

### Is my code sent to external services?
When using OpenAI or Anthropic as the model provider, portions of your code are sent to their APIs for test generation. We provide IP protection features to redact sensitive code before transmission.

### How much does it cost to use QA Agent?
QA Agent itself is open-source and free to use. However, you'll need an API key for your chosen model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or GitHub Copilot), which may have associated costs based on usage.

## Setup and Installation

### What are the minimum system requirements?
QA Agent requires Python 3.9 or higher and approximately 200MB of disk space for all dependencies. We recommend at least 4GB of RAM for larger projects.

### Do I need to install any other tools?
For basic functionality, you only need Python. For incremental testing, Git and the `gitpython` package are required. Sourcegraph integration requires a Sourcegraph account and API token.

### Can QA Agent be installed in a Docker container?
Yes, QA Agent can be used in containerised environments. See our [Installation](/installation#docker-installation) guide for details.

## Usage

### How do I set up my API key?
You can set your API key as an environment variable (e.g., `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"`), or QA Agent will prompt you for it when needed.

### How long does it take to generate tests?
The time depends on:
- Size of your codebase
- Number of functions to test
- Complexity of your code
- Whether you're using parallel processing

Small projects might complete in minutes, while larger codebases could take hours.

### Can I run QA Agent on specific files only?
Currently, QA Agent analyses the entire repository, but you can use the incremental testing feature to focus only on recently changed files.

### What test frameworks are supported?
Currently, QA Agent generates tests for pytest and unittest. Support for additional test frameworks is planned for future releases.

## Troubleshooting

### QA Agent isn't finding my functions
Check that your files have the correct extensions for supported languages and aren't in directories that might be ignored (like `venv` or `node_modules`).

### Generated tests are failing
This can happen if:
- Your code requires complex test setup
- There are dependencies not visible to QA Agent
- Your code relies on external services

You can use the generated tests as a starting point and modify them as needed.

### Parallel processing isn't working
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install gitpython
```

Also check that you have specified the `--parallel` flag and the `--max-workers` value isn't too high for your system's capabilities.

### I'm getting API errors
Verify that:
1. Your API key is valid
2. You have sufficient quota/credits with your provider
3. You've set the correct environment variable for your chosen provider

## Advanced Features

### What is incremental testing?
Incremental testing only generates tests for files that have changed recently (according to Git history). This is useful for active development to focus on new or modified code.

### How does IP protection work?
IP protection redacts sensitive code patterns, functions, or entire files before sending to external AI providers. You can configure specific patterns to protect in a rules file.

### Can QA Agent be integrated into CI/CD pipelines?
Yes, QA Agent can be run as part of your CI/CD process. See our [Running](/running#running-in-cicd-pipelines) guide for examples.

### What is the Sourcegraph integration for?
Sourcegraph integration enhances test generation by finding similar code examples across public repositories, providing better context for the AI to understand how your code should be tested.
