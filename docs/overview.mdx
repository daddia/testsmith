# QA Agent Overview

## What is QA Agent?

QA Agent is a Python-based intelligent testing assistant that automatically generates, validates, and maintains unit tests for your codebase. Using advanced AI, it analyses your code to identify functions with poor or no test coverage, then creates and validates appropriate tests to improve your overall code quality.

## Key Features

- **AI-powered test generation**: Automatically creates unit tests for your functions and methods
- **Intelligent coverage analysis**: Identifies critical areas of your code that need testing
- **Test validation**: Runs generated tests to ensure they work correctly
- **Parallel processing**: Speeds up test generation through multi-threaded execution
- **Incremental testing**: Focus only on files that have changed recently
- **Sourcegraph integration**: Enhances test generation with additional code context
- **IP protection**: Safeguards sensitive code when using external AI providers

## Why Use QA Agent?

- **Save time**: Automate the creation of boilerplate test code
- **Improve quality**: Catch bugs before they reach production
- **Boost coverage**: Systematically increase your test coverage metrics
- **Reduce friction**: Make testing less of a chore for your development team

## How It Works

1. QA Agent analyses your codebase to identify functions with insufficient test coverage
2. It prioritises functions based on complexity and importance
3. The AI generates appropriate unit tests for each function
4. Generated tests are validated to ensure they pass
5. Failed tests are automatically fixed or flagged for human review

## Supported Languages

- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
